# BBEdit-scripts

This package ("pyscripts-v0.6.bbpackage") contains scripts which extend BBEditâ€™s
capabilities. They are a collection of scripts that perform common tasks helpful when
writing in RST or Markdown. They also demonstrate techniques that can be used to extend
BBEdit to perform almost anything you might require.

Either build the package yourself or download the pre-built ZIP.

The README in the package describes the different scripts included and how to install it.
